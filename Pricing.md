To ensure accuracy in recalculating the plans with a target cost of 10% while maintaining the same pricing structure, let's re-evaluate the calculations, focusing on the cost per token and the number of queries allowed under each plan.
 
### Re-evaluation of Costs
 
1. **Blended Rate**: $0.0875 per 1M tokens
2. **Cost per Token**:
   - $0.0875 / 1,000,000 = $0.0000000875
3. **Cost for 500 Tokens**:
   - 500 × $0.0000000875 = $0.00004375
 
### Plan Adjustments
 
#### Basic Plan
- **Current Price**: $100
- **Current Queries**: 200
- **Current Cost**: 200 × $0.00004375 = $0.00875
- **Target Cost (10%)**: $10
 
To achieve a 10% cost:
- New Cost per Query = $10 / Number of Queries
- $10 / $0.00004375 ≈ 228,571 queries
 
#### Professional Plan
- **Current Price**: $500
- **Current Queries**: 600
- **Current Cost**: 600 × $0.00004375 = $0.02625
- **Target Cost (10%)**: $50
 
To achieve a 10% cost:
- New Cost per Query = $50 / Number of Queries
- $50 / $0.00004375 ≈ 1,142,857 queries
 
#### Enterprise Plan
- **Current Price**: $1000
- **Current Queries**: 1200
- **Current Cost**: 1200 × $0.00004375 = $0.0525
- **Target Cost (10%)**: $100
 
To achieve a 10% cost:
- New Cost per Query = $100 / Number of Queries
- $100 / $0.00004375 ≈ 2,285,714 queries
 
### Summary of Adjusted Plans
 
- **Basic Plan**:
  - Price: $100
  - Adjusted Queries: Approximately 228,571 queries
 
- **Professional Plan**:
  - Price: $500
  - Adjusted Queries: Approximately 1,142,857 queries
 
- **Enterprise Plan**:
  - Price: $1000
  - Adjusted Queries: Approximately 2,285,714 queries
 
### Justification
 
The recalculated number of queries reflects the correct cost per token and ensures that the cost of providing the service remains at approximately 10% of the revenue for each plan. This adjustment aligns with the desired profitability margin while maintaining the same pricing structure.
