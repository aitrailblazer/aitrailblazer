## Integrating Input Queries into Your Application

To effectively handle these queries within your application, consider the following steps:

### a. Parsing User Input

Ensure that your application can **interpret user input** and map it to the appropriate kernel functions. This can be achieved through:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilize the AI model (e.g., GPT-4) to understand the intent and extract relevant parameters.
  
- **Function Invocation Logic:** Based on the interpreted intent, call the corresponding kernel function with the necessary arguments.

### b. Handling Function Responses

After invoking a kernel function, process its response to present it to the user in a friendly format.

### c. Example Integration Workflow

1. **User Input:**  
   `"How many days are there between today and Christmas?"`

2. **AI Model Interpretation:**  
   - **Intent:** Calculate the difference in days.
   - **Extracted Dates:**  
     - **Start Date:** Today (`DateTime.Today`)
     - **End Date:** Christmas (`new DateTime(2024, 12, 25)`)

3. **Function Invocation:**  
   - Call `date_difference_days` with `start = DateTime.Today` and `end = new DateTime(2024, 12, 25)`

4. **Function Response:**  
   - `88` (days)

5. **Application Response:**  
   `"There are 88 days between today (September 28, 2024) and Christmas (December 25, 2024)."`

## Best Practices for Writing Input Queries

To maximize the effectiveness of your kernel functions, adhere to the following best practices when designing input queries:

### a. Clarity and Specificity

- **Be Clear:** Ensure that the query clearly states what the user wants to know.
  
  - **Good Example:** `"What is the local time in Tokyo right now?"`
  
  - **Bad Example:** `"Time in Tokyo?"`

### b. Provide Necessary Parameters

- **Include All Required Information:** If a function requires specific parameters, ensure the query includes them.
  
  - **Good Example:** `"Add 5 days to October 10, 2024."`
  
  - **Bad Example:** `"Add days to date."`

### c. Use Recognizable Date and Time Formats

- **Consistent Formatting:** Use standard date and time formats to facilitate accurate parsing.
  
  - **Good Example:** `"Convert '07/04/2024' to a DateTime object using 'MM/dd/yyyy' format."`
  
  - **Bad Example:** `"Convert July fourth to date."`

### d. Handle Ambiguities

- **Clarify Ambiguous Queries:** If a query could be interpreted in multiple ways, provide additional context.
  
  - **Example:**  
    `"What is the difference in days between the start of the project on September 28 and the deadline on December 25?"`

### e. Utilize Contextual Information

- **Maintain Context:** If your application maintains conversational context, ensure that follow-up queries reference previous information appropriately.
  
  - **Example:**  
    - **User:** `"What is the current time in UTC?"`  
    - **App:** `"The current time in UTC is 12:30 PM."`  
    - **User:** `"What time is that in Pacific Standard Time?"`  
    - **App:** `"12:30 PM UTC is 4:30 AM Pacific Standard Time."`

## Final Thoughts

By structuring your input queries thoughtfully and leveraging the comprehensive set of date and time functions you've integrated, your application can provide **powerful and flexible** date and time-related functionalities to users. Remember to **test extensively** with various query types to ensure that all functions behave as expected and handle edge cases gracefully.
