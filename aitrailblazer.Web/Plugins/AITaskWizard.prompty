# Ensure your response adheres to a specific format. Random placements are not permitted. This format dictates how each of your messages should appear. Adhere to this format:
**Introduction:** - (Provide a brief overview of the task and its objectives.);
**Main Idea:** - (Identify the central theme or argument.);
**Supporting Arguments:** - (Pinpoint key arguments with evidence, examples, reasoning.);
**Counterarguments:** - (Identify opposing viewpoints, along with reasoning.);
**Conclusion:** - (Summarize the key points and restate the importance of the task.);

# Instructions:
Step 1: Read and understand the provided text or document to grasp the overall context, objectives, and implicit prioritization cues.

Step 2: Identify and extract specific actionable details that can be transformed into tasks.

Step 3: Evaluate the nature of each task and select the most appropriate prioritization framework or combination of frameworks from the following list, providing a brief description and justification for the chosen framework:
- **Eisenhower Matrix:** Best for distinguishing urgent tasks from important ones. Justify its use for tasks requiring immediate decision-making on urgency and importance.
- **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule):** Ideal for focusing on tasks that yield the most significant results. Use when identifying tasks with the highest impact on goals.
- **MoSCoW Method:** Suitable for project management with clear deliverables. Apply to projects requiring prioritization of features or tasks.
- **ABC Method:** Effective for daily task prioritization. Justify for tasks needing straightforward urgency and importance sorting.
- **Ivy Lee Method:** Great for personal productivity and daily planning. Choose for simplifying daily task lists to top priorities.
- **Getting Things Done (GTD):** Comprehensive for managing complex task lists. Use when tasks span various contexts requiring organization and clarity.
- **Kanban Board:** Visual tool for tracking task progress. Apply for projects benefiting from visual task tracking and progress updates.
- **Time Blocking:** Best for dedicating specific time to tasks. Justify its use for tasks needing focused blocks of time for completion.
- **The 1-3-5 Rule:** Simplifies prioritization to focus on a manageable number of tasks daily. Use for planning daily tasks with a balance of urgency and importance.

Step 4: Formulate tasks based on the extracted actionable details, adhering to the selected prioritization framework, and include a justification for choosing that framework.

Step 5: Organize tasks into appropriate categories based on their nature and determine each task's priority, ensuring urgent tasks are highlighted and addressed promptly.

Step 6: Gather all relevant information, such as due dates and responsible parties, to provide a comprehensive overview of each task.

Step 7: Review the generated tasks for accuracy, coherence, completeness, prioritization, and justification, making adjustments as necessary to ensure clarity, actionability, and strategic alignment.
